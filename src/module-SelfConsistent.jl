# ON since 17-Aug-2026, at the same depth 2 the mean-field driver uses.  It reaches the SAME solution --
# Ar 3s^2 3p^6 agrees to 4.3e-9 once accuracyScf is tight enough to converge at all -- and is 1.4x to 1.9x
# faster, the gain GROWING with the accuracy demanded (1.47x at 1e-6, 1.79x at 1e-9, 1.89x at 1e-12).
# On Be 4-config it is also the more STABLE of the two: across accuracyScf = 1e-6, 1e-9, 1e-12 it drifts by
# 1e-5 where the plain iteration swings 6.5e-5 NON-MONOTONICALLY, and it gets there in 211 s against 1093 s.
#
# It could not be switched on until 18aaf5f.  Anderson perturbs the orbital tails just enough to move the
# old mtp cut, which made TestFrames.testMethod_OrbitalOrthonormality report 6.5e-08 where the plain
# iteration gave 6.8e-10 -- an artefact of the truncated integral, not of the orbitals, which were
# orthonormal to 1e-17 throughout.  With the tails kept, both give ~1e-16.
#
# STILL OPEN, and NOT fixed by any of this: plain AL does not converge for a multi-configuration basis with

#
# THE 30-Aug ROW WAS TAKEN WITH maxIterationsScf = 200, AND THAT IS NOT A DETAIL. AsfSettings() defaults the
# ceiling to 24, and the plain Ne iteration needs 28: a first attempt at this measurement reported "24 it" for
# Ne, which is the CEILING and not a convergence count, beside a NOT-CONVERGED flag easy to read as a property
# of the case rather than of the settings. Ne was therefore re-run as a CONTROL for the new row and reproduces
# 28 exactly. Any iteration count taken here without raising the ceiling first measures the default.
# Ne's depth-2 count came out 12 against the 13 recorded above; the grid differs (Basics.recommendedGrid was
# used in 2026-08-30, and the 12-Aug measurement does not record what it used), so this is most likely the
# convergence path rather than a change. It is left standing rather than smoothed over.
# Ar+ is the SMALLEST gain of the five (1.27x, against 2.15x Ne, 1.64x Ar, 2.50x Fe, 1.55x Ne+), consistent
# with Anderson helping most where the plain iteration converges slowest -- a 1s-hole system already converges
# quickly.
#
# Depth 2 is the measured optimum; 3 is nearly equal, and LARGER IS WORSE (Ne: 24 it at depth 5, 36 at 12),
# the usual ill-conditioning of a long Anderson history.  Note that depth 0 in the Anderson driver itself is a
# JACOBI sweep and does NOT converge in 60 iterations -- the Gauss-Seidel ordering of the original driver is
# what makes the plain iteration viable at all.
#
# STANDARD SINCE 12-Aug-2026 (was 0 = the plain iteration when this was first added).  Setting it to 0
# restores the old path exactly, which is how the two were compared.  Making it the default is a deliberate
# editorial act: both iterations reach the same self-consistent solution, but only to within accuracyScf,
# so results can move by ~1e-6.  What that costs was measured by regenerating every approved reference with
# it on: 27 of 29 came out BITWISE IDENTICAL, one moved by 3.0e-09, and the only large apparent change --
# test-Cascade-StepwiseDecay -- was not numerical at all, but two DEGENERATE levels swapping index labels
# (all 606 transition rows the same set).

        be replaced. `performSCF` acts on that answer by switching to `Basics.NuclearField()`, so the condition is

        WHY THIS IS WORTH SAYING OUT LOUD RATHER THAN A NOTE SOMEWHERE. A mean field such as DFS is built from the total
        electron density, so with a SINGLE electron it contains that electron's own charge: the electron is repelled
        by itself. The bound orbital and the continuum orbital then solve DIFFERENT one-body operators, which is not
        a small error and does not look like one. Measured 30-Aug-2026 on H(1s) -> continuum: the Coulomb and
        Babushkin photoionization cross sections, which are EQUAL for exact hydrogenic wavefunctions, come out in
        the ratio 1.238, 1.299 and 1.294 at omega/I = 1.5, 2 and 3 under `DFSField()`, and 1.000000 at every one of

        That 24-30 % discrepancy was carried on the priority list for weeks as a suspected defect of the CONTINUUM
        machinery, and the three suspects it named were all innocent. `AsfSettings()` defaults to `DFSField()`, so

        This exists because choosing the box is the step most likely to be got wrong, and getting it wrong
        does not look like a grid problem: the record attributes four separate "bugs" -- an E3 rate 1000x too
        small, a Zeeman kappa <= -3 failure, a MultipolePolarizibility defect and a Breit sign flip -- to a
        box that did not match the orbitals, and each was first blamed on the angular machinery.  The derived
        box beats JAC's hand-chosen default grid for every system it has been measured on (see
        Basics.recommendedGrid), by 2.9e-3 Ha for argon and 2.3e-2 Ha for Ti+.

        ONE CASE NEEDS THE GRID GIVEN BY HAND.  The estimate cannot tell a spectroscopic Rydberg shell from a
        CORRELATION shell of the same n and l, and reads both as diffuse: a beryllium basis carrying 3s and 3d
        for correlation is given 67 a.u., which is right for a real 1s^2 2s 3s state and far too generous for
        a correlation orbital that contracts onto the valence region.  Where the high-n shells are there to
        correlate rather than to be occupied, pass a grid, or pass `rbox` to Basics.recommendedGrid.
