        THE ROUTE IS PART OF THE KEY, which is why ONE cache serves every X^L. `XL_Coulomb`,
        `XL_CoulombKinkAware` and `XL_Breit` all answer the same kind of question -- a strength for rank L
        and four orbitals, asked for by a spin-angular coefficient -- so what separates them belongs here rather than in three separate
        dictionaries. `route` is one of :Coulomb, :CoulombKinkAware, :Gaunt or :Breit, and `factor` carries the photon-frequency scaling of
        CoulombBreit(factor); it is 0. for every route that has none. `quadrature` is :direct or :swept and carries the two ways of evaluating a
        Breit radial integral -- the same physics by a different summation, so they must not share a memo; it is :direct for every route that
        offers no choice. IT WAS ADDED 04-Sep-2026 AND THE KEY TYPE HAD TO BE WIDENED WITH IT: XLKey is a CONCRETE tuple type, so a key of the
        wrong arity fails at the `setindex!`, deep inside the CI build and ONLY on the cached path -- which is exactly the path a probe that
        calls XL_Breit directly does not exercise.

        `Subshell` is a plain immutable struct of two Int64 fields, so Julia hashes it structurally and it
        enters the key directly -- there is no string to build, and none to read back when debugging.

`struct  InteractionStrength.XLCache`
    ... memoises the effective interaction strengths X^L(abcd) of ONE matrix.

        WHY THIS IS A PARAMETER AND NOT A GLOBAL. Within a single CI matrix the same rank and subshell quadruple recur across many CSF
        pairs, so the double radial integral is worth doing once. But the key holds subshell LABELS, and labels identify orbitals only
        within one basis: two bases can both contain a "2s_1/2" whose radial functions differ entirely. Until 15-Aug-2026 the store was a
        module global wiped by whoever built a matrix -- `Hamiltonian.performCI`, `performCIKinkAware` and
        `Basics.compute(::CImatrixWithSymmetryJP)` each called an `XL_*_reset_storage` some 200 lines from
        the fill -- so the key was unambiguous only because of a promise made in another module, which nothing checked and no signature
        mentioned.

        Handing the cache to the function that fills it makes that promise a fact: the cache is created by the matrix builder and goes out
        of scope when the matrix is finished, so it CANNOT outlive the basis whose labels it uses. It also makes concurrent matrix builds
        safe by construction, since two matrices cannot share a cache that neither of them owns.

        This is the pattern JAC already uses elsewhere -- `Bsplines.setupLocalMatrix` and
        `generateTTpMatrix!` take a `storage::Dict`, `RadialIntegrals.ScreenedPotentialCache` is built and
        passed, and the EOL solver threads its own `cache1p`/`cache2p` -- so the XL_* strengths were the one remaining place that kept its

        THE ONE VERSION. Introduced 09-Aug-2026 to replace a family of seven variants that had accumulated along historical routes --
        MabEmissionJohnsony, MabEmissionJohnsony_Wu, MbaEmissionJohnsonx, MbaEmissionCheng, MbaAbsorptionCheng, MbaEmissionAndreyOld and
        MbaEmissionMigdalek -- which differed in normalisation, in return type, in sign and in argument order, so that amplitudes computed
        through different ones could not be added.

        ARGUMENT ORDER: the orbitals are passed in the order they appear, `MabEmission(..., a, b, ...)` returning <a || O || b>. Until
        03-Sep-2026 the two were declared the other way round, so that the SECOND argument was the one on the left; the signature was
        turned round and every call site swapped in the same commit, which changes no number. The old arrangement needed a paragraph of
        prose to explain it, and prose that reads like physics but is really about a parameter list is worse than no prose.

        THE GAUGES, following Grant, J. Phys. B 7, 12 (1974): `Coulomb` is the velocity form and `Babushkin` the length form of the electric
        multipole operator; `Magnetic` is used for magnetic multipoles. For exact one-body eigenfunctions the two electric forms must agree
        at the physical photon energy, and here they do -- H 1s-2p gives Coulomb/Babushkin = 1.000000 on shell. Away from that energy they
        legitimately differ: the length form scales with the omega it is given, while the velocity form carries the level difference through
        <f|p|i> = i m (E_f - E_i) <f|r|i>, so an OFF-SHELL call is not gauge invariant and must not be expected to be.

        THE VALUE IS REAL, and this deserves a word because the literature usually writes it as complex. The Racah phase of the angular
        factor is (-1)^(j_b + 1/2); j_b is half-integer, so that exponent is an integer and the phase is +-1, alternating with j_b. Until
        09-Aug-2026 `AngularMomentum.JohnsonI` raised (-1+0im) to `jb.num + 1/2`, i.e. to a HALF-integer, which returned a constant -i for
        every j_b: it turned every matrix element imaginary and, worse, discarded the alternating sign. With that corrected the quantity is
        real, as it should be. Any overall factor i that a given convention prefers is a global phase and cancels from every observable; the
        j-dependent sign does NOT cancel and is carried here.

        WHAT IS INSIDE, AND WHAT THE CALLER MUST SUPPLY. This function returns the SINGLE-ELECTRON reduced matrix element and nothing else.
        A many-electron amplitude is assembled by the caller as

            amplitude = sum_(r,s) c_r c_s sum_coeff  coeff.T * MabEmission(...) / sqrt(2j_a+1) * sqrt(2J_f+1)

        with the angular coefficients from SpinAngular and the CI mixing coefficients. NO FURTHER MULTIPOLARITY FACTOR IS TO BE APPLIED: a
        factor sqrt((2L+1)(L+1)/L) appears commented out at the PhotoEmission call site, and it is commented out CORRECTLY -- restoring it
        would multiply E1 by 2.449 and E2 by 2.739 and destroy the agreement documented below.

        VALIDATED, and additive across multipoles. Against Jitrik & Bunge, J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data 33, 1059 (2004), hydrogen Z = 1,
        point-nucleus Dirac -- the same model as the test:

            transition        JAC A(Cou)      JAC A(Bab)      reference      ratio
            E1 1s-2p_1/2      6.268354e+08    6.268020e+08    6.2649e+08     1.000498

        The three ratios agree with one another, which is the statement that E1, M1 and E2 amplitudes computed through this function stand
        on a common footing and may be added as they occur in the full electron-photon interaction.

        THE COULOMB GAUGE IS STRUCTURALLY ZERO FOR A DIAGONAL ELECTRIC MULTIPOLE, i.e. whenever the two orbitals belong to the SAME subshell
        and hence kapa == kapb. The Coulomb branch below is built only from I^+ and I^-, and there both die at once: the prefactor
        (kapa-kapb) vanishes, and I^-(a,a) = int j_L (P_a Q_a - Q_a P_a) dr is identically zero. The Babushkin branch keeps J_L = int j_L
        (P_a^2 + Q_a^2) dr and stays finite. This is not a defect of either branch: the velocity form of an electric multipole between two
        states built on the same orbital vanishes at the one-body level, and the amplitude of a transition INSIDE one configuration (2p^4

        Coulomb/Babushkin ratio as a gauge-consistency check -- there is nothing there to compare. The magnetic branch is unaffected, since
        it carries (kapa+kapb) = 2*kappa and I^+(a,a) != 0; that is why M1 fine-structure rates inside a term come out right to a few parts
        in 1000.

        THE BREIT INTERACTION IN JAC -- THE REFERENCE FORMULATION
        Written 13-Aug-2026 as Stage 1 of the frequency-dependent Breit work, BEFORE any code was changed, so
        that the implementation below can be checked against a statement of the physics rather than against
        itself.

        PROVENANCE, STATED HONESTLY: the standard references are Grant & Pyper, J. Phys. B 9, 761 (1976) and
        Grant, "Relativistic Quantum Theory of Atoms and Molecules" (2007), ch. 8.  THIS BLOCK WAS NOT
        TRANSCRIBED FROM THEM -- it is written from recollection of the standard formulation, cross-checked
        against secondary sources only.  It must therefore be checked against the primary texts by someone who
        has them before any number produced from it is trusted.  Where it has been confirmed NUMERICALLY, that
        is said at the point in question.

        1. THE OPERATOR.  Exchange of one transverse photon of frequency omega between electrons 1 and 2, in the
           COULOMB GAUGE:

               B(omega) = - (alpha_1 . alpha_2) cos(omega r_12) / r_12
                          + (alpha_1 . grad_1)(alpha_2 . grad_2) [cos(omega r_12) - 1] / (omega^2 r_12)

           The second term is finite as omega -> 0 only through a cancellation: [cos(x) - 1]/x^2 -> -1/2.

        2. UNITS OF omega -- AND A DEFECT.  omega is a WAVE NUMBER, not an energy.  In atomic units

               omega = |E_a - E_c| / c,        c = 137.036 ,

           so that omega*r is the dimensionless phase the Bessel functions below require.  Retardation is small
           precisely because omega*r ~ (Delta E) r / c << 1 for atomic transitions.

           XL_Breit_densities below formed  omg_ac = factor * abs(E_a - E_c)  and NEVER DIVIDED BY c until
           13-Aug-2026, feeding an energy in Hartree into sf_bessel_jl(nu, omega*r) as if it were a wave number
           and overstating the phase by c = 137.  FIXED.  It never affected a published number, since no branch
           consumed those values (see point 6).

        3. THE TWO omega -> 0 LIMITS ARE DIFFERENT OPERATORS, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS A GAUGE CHOICE.

               Coulomb gauge, omega -> 0:   B = - 1/(2 r_12) [ alpha_1.alpha_2 + (alpha_1.rhat)(alpha_2.rhat) ]
                                                ... the BREIT operator            -> JAC: CoulombBreit(0.)
               Feynman gauge, omega -> 0:   G = - alpha_1.alpha_2 / r_12
                                                ... the GAUNT operator            -> JAC: CoulombGaunt

           These are NOT the same approximation.  The total one-photon exchange is gauge independent; truncating
           at omega -> 0 is what breaks that, which is why two gauges leave two different instantaneous operators.
           The retardation correction to instantaneous Gaunt is O(alpha^2) -- LARGER than the omega-independent
           Coulomb-gauge term itself.  A user choosing CoulombGaunt over CoulombBreit(0.) is therefore making an
           undocumented gauge choice, and the frequency dependence does NOT vanish in either gauge.

        4. MULTIPOLE DECOMPOSITION.  XL_Breit_coefficients splits the operator into two families, and this split
           IS the Gaunt/retardation split (onlyGaunt returns after the 'T' blocks):

               'T'  (magnetic / GAUNT)      nu = L-1, L, L+1,   four mu permutations each
               'S'  (RETARDATION)           nu = L +- 1

           The many-electron angular factors are NOT computed here: they come from SpinAngular as
           Coefficient2p(nu, a, b, c, d, V), and the CI matrix forms V * XL_Breit(nu, ...).  The coefficients
           below belong to the OPERATOR, not to the CSFs.

        5. THE RADIAL KERNELS.  The two kinds enter DIFFERENTLY, which is easy to get wrong:

               Gaunt / 'T':   the static kernel Ubar_nu = r_<^nu / r_>^(nu+1) times a FREQUENCY FACTOR
                                  V_nu = -omega (2nu+1) j_nu(omega r_<) y_nu(omega r_>)  ->  1   as omega -> 0.

               Retardation / 'S':  the kernel W_(L-1,L+1,L) of Grant & Pyper equation (6) IN FULL -- it is not a
                                   factor on Ubar_nu, and for r_1 < r_2 it is a difference of two 1/omega^2-
                                   divergent pieces, which is the whole numerical difficulty.

           Both are evaluated through the normalised phi, psi of besselPhiPsi, so the cancellations are taken
           ALGEBRAICALLY and each kernel reaches its omega -> 0 limit by construction rather than by a special case.
           See the closures V() and W() in XL_Breit_densities for the derivations and their verification.

           MEASURED 13-Aug-2026, on the forms that stood here before: V() omitted the leading factor omega
           (V*omega/static -> 1.000001 at omega = 1e-3 for nu = 1, while V/static -> 1000), and W() was equation (6)
           with the omega missing from its first term AND that term's sign reversed, so its cancellation failed
           outright -- neither W, W*omega nor W*omega^2 converged.  Neither could ever have been switched on.

        6. WHAT IS COMPUTED.  Since 14-Aug-2026 both parts are frequency dependent, and the argument `factor` of
           CoulombBreit(factor) does exactly what its name says: it scales omega, so that

               factor = 0  ->  omega = 0, the standard frequency-independent Breit interaction, recovered as the
                               EXACT limit of the same expressions rather than by a separate code path;
               factor = 1  ->  the full frequency-dependent interaction at omega = |E_a - E_c| / c.

           Before that date nothing frequency dependent was computed at all: omg_ac and omg_bd were formed and then
           discarded, factor == 0 taking wy = 1 and factor == 1 taking wy = 1.05, a placeholder with no derivation
           that is now gone.  No JAC number published before 14-Aug-2026 contains a retardation correction.

           NOT included: for a given 'S' permutation only the radial ordering carried by that permutation is
           summed, its transpose supplying the other.  This is exact at omega = 0 and drops a term of relative
           order omega^2 WITHIN the retardation -- O(omega^4) in the interaction -- since W's r_1 > r_2 branch is
           itself O(omega^2).  With omega ~ 1e-2 for the transitions of interest that is a ~1e-8 relative effect.


        7. AUDIT OF THE ANGULAR COEFFICIENTS, 13-Aug-2026.  XL_Breit_coefficients was compared TERM BY TERM against
           Grant & Pyper's table 2 and against GRASP2018's rci90/cxk.f90, which implements the same table.
           RESULT: THE ANGULAR DECOMPOSITION IS CORRECT.  Every weight, every kappa factor and every mu ordering
           agrees.  In GRASP's notation DK1 = kappa_c - kappa_a, DK2 = kappa_d - kappa_b, F1..F4 = DK -+ K,
           G1..G4 = DK -+ (K+1), H = the two CL reduced matrix elements with the odd-L sign:

             'T', nu = L    : JAC -(ka+kc)(kb+kd)/(L(L+1)), equal for all mu   ==  GRASP S(1..4) = -(KA+KC)(KD+KB)H/(K(K+1))
             'T', nu = L+1  : JAC L/((L+1)(2L+1)(2L+3)), four kappa products   ==  GRASP A = H*K/((K+1)(2K+1)(2K+3)),
                              G1G3, G2G4, G1G4, G2G3
             'T', nu = L-1  : JAC (L+1)/(L(2L-1)(2L+1))                        ==  GRASP A = H*(K+1)/(K(2K+1)(2K-1)),
                              F2F4, F1F3, F2F3, F1F4
             'S', all 8 mu  : JAC 1/(2L+1)^2 times, in order,
                              F2G3, F4G1, F1G4, F3G2, F2G4, F3G1, F1G3, F4G2   ==  GRASP S(5), S(6), ..., S(12)

           THE ONE STRUCTURAL DIFFERENCE, and it is deliberate rather than a defect: JAC emits each 'S' coefficient
           TWICE, at nu = L+1 with weight +[L]/2 and at nu = L-1 with -[L]/2, [L] = 2L+1.  That is precisely Grant's
           STATIC LIMIT of the retardation kernel, their equations (9)-(10),

               W_(nu-1,nu+1,nu) -> -(1/2)[nu] ( Ubar_(nu-1) - Ubar_(nu+1) ),

           with Ubar the one-sided kernel of equation (10) -- which the r/s loop below realises by summing only
           s <= r and halving the diagonal, since U = Ubar(1,2) + Ubar(2,1).  Signs included, JAC matches.

           CONSEQUENCE FOR THE FREQUENCY-DEPENDENT RETARDATION, AS IT STOOD ON 13-Aug-2026: it could not be switched
           on by changing a multiplier, because the 'S' entries carried the static limit inside their coefficients.

           **THAT WORK WAS DONE THE NEXT DAY AND THIS PARAGRAPH IS NO LONGER A TO-DO -- corrected 04-Sep-2026, after
           it was read at face value and nearly acted on.**  Since 14-Aug-2026 (commit 7c82e45) each mu emits a
           SINGLE entry carrying the multipole L itself and the bare coefficient xcc, and the whole kernel
           W_(L-1,L+1,L) of equation (6) is supplied by XL_Breit_densities; see the comment at the 'S' block of
           XL_Breit_coefficients, which records the collapse and why no extra prefactor is needed.  The eight mu
           terms are four TRANSPOSED PAIRS, matching the two-term W(1,2) / W(2,1) structure of equation (8).

           nu = L-1, L, L+1 are three distinct tensor ranks and the eight 'S' mu terms are Grant's table 2 in full.
           The only genuine redundancy was entries sharing (kind, nu, a, b, c, d), which differ by a scalar alone;
           XL_Breit_densitiesSwept sums those coefficients and sweeps once (commit 94df5bc, 11.94 -> 7.15
           sub-coefficients per strength).  Measured 04-Sep-2026, generating the coefficients is ~1 % of a swept
           Breit strength, so there is no speed argument for touching this decomposition either.

        WHY THIS HAS TO REFUSE RATHER THAN WARN. The photon wave number is omega = factor |E_a - E_c| / c, taken from the ORBITAL
        ENERGIES. Both EOL solvers (SelfConsistent.solveOptimizedLevelField and ...ByRotation) build their orbitals with
        `Bsplines.generateOrbitalFromVector(sh, 0.0, ...)` -- a rotation- or functional-optimised orbital is not the eigenfunction of any
        one-particle operator, so it carries no eigenvalue and the field is left at zero. Every orbital of a RAS or EOL basis therefore
        has energy 0.0 exactly, omega comes out 0 for every pair, and CoulombBreit(1.) silently returns the CoulombBreit(0.) answer:
        the retardation the caller asked for is absent and nothing says so. Measured 04-Sep-2026 on Be-like U: all four orbitals of the
        reference layer at 0.0, against -4705.73 / -1185.21 / -1174.16 / -1018.99 Ha from a mean-field SCF on the same configurations.

        Four bound orbitals at EXACTLY 0.0 is the signature of the unset field and not of physics, so the test is safe; a continuum
        orbital carries its own positive energy and an AL or DFS basis its eigenvalues, which is why example-Ad, -Df and -Dv keep working.
        The remedy is one of: CoulombBreit(0.), which is the EXACT omega -> 0 limit and what every published JAC RAS number used; or a
        mean-field basis, whose orbitals carry eigenvalues. Giving EOL orbitals a defined energy is a physics question -- the diagonal
        Lagrange multiplier is the candidate -- and is on the priority list rather than guessed at here.

    # W is Grant & Pyper's RETARDATION kernel.  Their paper carries two objects both written W, and it matters
    # which one is meant here:

    #   * equation (4)  W_nu = ( V_nu - U_nu ) / omega^2  -- an auxiliary of the general equation (5); and
    #   * equation (6)  W_(nu-1,nu+1,nu)(1,2)             -- the one that actually appears in the B^(2) term
    #                                                        of their equation (8), and hence the one needed.

    # It is equation (6) that this closure implements:

    #     W_(nu-1,nu+1,nu)(1,2) = [nu] omega j_(nu-1)(omega r_1) n_(nu+1)(omega r_2)
    #                             + ([nu]^2/omega^2) r_1^(nu-1) / r_2^(nu+2)              for r_1 < r_2
    #                           = [nu] omega n_(nu-1)(omega r_1) j_(nu+1)(omega r_2)      for r_1 > r_2

    # with [nu] = 2nu+1, and W_(nu+1,nu-1,nu)(1,2) = W_(nu-1,nu+1,nu)(2,1).  The two orderings are DIFFERENT
    # functions, not one function of r_< and r_>, which is why equation (8) carries both of them.

    # For r_1 < r_2 this is a DIFFERENCE OF TWO 1/omega^2-DIVERGENT QUANTITIES, which is the whole numerical
    # difficulty.  Substituting the normalised phi, psi of besselPhiPsi,
    #     j_(nu-1)(x) = phi_(nu-1)(x) x^(nu-1)/(2nu-1)!!      n_(nu+1)(x) = -psi_(nu+1)(x) (2nu+1)!!/x^(nu+2)
    # the first term becomes exactly -([nu]^2/omega^2) phi psi r_1^(nu-1)/r_2^(nu+2), so the divergence
    # cancels ALGEBRAICALLY against the second and what remains is

    #     W = -([nu]^2/omega^2) (r_1^(nu-1)/r_2^(nu+2)) (a + b + a*b),   a = phi_(nu-1)-1,  b = psi_(nu+1)-1

    # in which nothing is subtracted numerically: a and b come straight from their own power series.
    # For r_1 > r_2 no cancellation arises and the same substitution gives an O(omega^2) expression.

    # VERIFIED against Grant's analytic omega -> 0 limit, their equations (9)-(10),
    #     W_(nu-1,nu+1,nu) -> -(1/2) [nu] ( Ubar_(nu-1) - Ubar_(nu+1) ),   Ubar_k = r_1^k/r_2^(k+1), r_1 < r_2

    # the deviation scaling as O(omega^2): 4.9e-3, 4.9e-5, 4.9e-7 at omega = 0.1, 0.01, 0.001 for nu = 1, and
    # likewise for nu = 2, 3.  That limit is precisely what the 'S' coefficients of XL_Breit_coefficients
    # already encode in their +-[nu]/2 weights, so at omega = 0 kernel and coefficients agree by construction.

    # Below omegaFloor the residual roundoff of a and b, amplified by 1/omega^2, exceeds that deviation, so
    # the analytic limit is returned instead -- the device of GRASP2018's IF (W < EPSI**2) in rci90/bessel.f90.

    # HISTORY.  What stood here before 13-Aug-2026 was equation (6) with the factor omega missing from its
    # first term and that term's sign reversed, so the cancellation failed outright; measured, neither W,
    # W*omega nor W*omega^2 converged, and two bare catch blocks then substituted wx = 1.0.  The rewrite of

`InteractionStrength.XL_Breit_densitiesSwept(xcList::Array{XLCoefficient,1}, factor::Float64, grid::Radial.Grid; tau::Float64=0.)`
    ... the same integral as XL_Breit_densities, accumulated in ONE PASS over the grid instead of a full double sum.
        A value::Float64 is returned. Selected by CoulombBreit(factor, :swept); :direct keeps the other form.

        WHY THIS IS POSSIBLE AT ALL, and it is the only idea in the function: EVERY Breit kernel factorises into a
        function of r_< times a function of r_>, so the inner integral over s <= r is a RUNNING SUM and need not be
        redone for each r. Term by term, with s the smaller radius:
          'T' (Gaunt)   V_nu(r_s,r_r) Ubar_nu  =  [phi_nu(omega r_s) r_s^nu] * [psi_nu(omega r_r) / r_r^(nu+1)]
          'S' at omega -> 0   W = -[nu]/2 (Ubar_(nu-1) - Ubar_(nu+1))                       -- TWO such products
          'S' at omega > 0    W = -([nu]^2/omega^2) r_s^(nu-1) r_r^-(nu+2) (a + b + a b)    -- THREE, since
                              a depends on r_s alone and b on r_r alone.
        The cost falls from O(N^2) to O(N) per sub-coefficient. On a 595-point grid with 11.9 sub-coefficients per
        strength the direct form visits 2.11 million grid points per Breit strength; this one visits some thousands.
        THE BESSEL FUNCTIONS COME ALONG FOR FREE: the direct form evaluates them per (r,s) PAIR, this one per point,
        which is the reuse the maintainer asked for on 04-Sep-2026 -- a corollary of separability, not a separate
        optimisation. (In the STATIC case, factor = 0., neither form evaluates a Bessel function at all.)

        THE DIAGONAL IS NOT PART OF THE SWEEP FOR 'S'. Grant's W is a DIFFERENT function for r_1 = r_2 than for
        r_1 < r_2 -- the direct form reaches its `else` branch there -- so that single term is added separately,
        which costs O(N) and keeps the two forms comparable term by term. 'T' has no such split: V is one
        expression in r_< and r_>, so its diagonal is carried by the sweep with the same halved weight.

        WHAT IT DOES NOT PROMISE: this is NOT bitwise identical to XL_Breit_densities, and cannot be -- the same
        products are summed in a different order. It is the same integral, and the difference is the floating-point
        associativity of the sum, not a change of physics. TestFrames.testMethod_BreitInteraction(), section (5), compares the two
        on real orbitals in both frequency regimes; keep that test, because an unused route rots (see XL_BreitDamped, whose body was
        `error("stop a")` behind a signature one argument short of its only caller, unnoticed for months).

        Subshell and Orbital roles across its methods and its derivation is not the one that was verified. Being plausible by analogy is

        the COLUMN's type (P for an L-column, Q for an S-column), while orbital b's component matching the ROW's type pairs with the column
        B-spline index. Consequently it is orbital c -- not b -- whose OWN B-spline expansion coefficients (cVector, the B-spline

        cheap grid-quadrature dot product. Three caches are needed because the row/column-type combination can be LL, LS, SL, or SS -- and,
        unlike the "direct" signature, a single screened potential cannot be shared across the whole (nsL+nsS) x (nsL+nsS) matrix here,

        opposite-sign corrections, both matched after the /4 fix to 5-6 significant figures), and (ii) the paper's own published He 1s2p g_J
